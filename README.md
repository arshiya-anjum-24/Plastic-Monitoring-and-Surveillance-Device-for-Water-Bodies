 Overview

This project presents a Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased Automatic Surface Vehicle (ASV) capable of detecting and monitoring plastic waste in water bodies using a machine learning model. The ASV captures live video feed, processes it in real-time to identify plastic objects, and transmits both live and processed feeds to a web-based control interface.

The system aims to support environmental monitoring and waste management initiatives by providing data-driven insights into the spread of plastic pollution.

 Key Features

Autonomous surface vehicle controlled via a web interface.

Live camera feed streamed to the website using Raspberry Pi.

Real-time plastic detection using a trained ML model (CNN).

GPS tracking of the vehicle with live location logs.

Heatmap visualization of plastic concentration levels.

Dashboard interface showing live and processed video feeds simultaneously.

 Technology Stack
 Hardware

Raspberry Pi 4

Pi Camera Module

GPS Module

Motor Driver (L298N)

DC Motors

Battery and Propeller System

 Software & Frameworks

Programming: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Flask (for communication between Pi and website)

ML/AI: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV

Frontend: Bootstrap, Chart.js (for heatmap visualization)

 *Working Principle*

The ASV moves across the water surface, capturing live video using the Pi camera.

The video feed is processed by the ML model running on the Raspberry Pi to detect plastic waste in real-time.

The results are streamed to the web dashboard, where users can view:

The live feed from the camera

The processed feed with detection overlays

The GPS coordinates of the ASV

A heatmap showing areas with higher detection frequency

All data is logged for further analysis and visualization.

üåç Impact

This project contributes toward clean water initiatives by offering an affordable and scalable way to:

Detect and map plastic pollution zones in lakes, ponds, and rivers.

Support real-time environmental monitoring.

Encourage IoT + AI‚Äìbased sustainability solutions.
