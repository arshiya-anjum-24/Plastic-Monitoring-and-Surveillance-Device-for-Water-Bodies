# Plastic-Monitoring-and-Surveillance-Device-for-Water-Bodies
This project presents a Raspberry Piâ€“based Automatic Surface Vehicle (ASV) designed to detect and classify plastic waste in water bodies using machine learning. The vehicle captures live video feed through a camera module and processes it using an onboard ML model to identify plastic objects in real time.
